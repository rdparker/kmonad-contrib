* Installation

** Windows
In PowerShell run

#+begin_src powershell
./Create-Shortcut.ps1 hawkbit.kbd
#+end_src

to create a shortcut that starts KMonad in a hidden window with the =hawkbit.kbd= configuration.  Then manually copy it to =%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp= and launch it.  The advantage of placing it in the =StartUp= directory is that it will launch when you log in.

** macOS
Copy =local.kmonad.macbook.plist= into =/Library/LaunchDaemons= and run

#+begin_src shell
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/local.kmonad.macbook.plist
#+end_src

*** TODO Create a script that writes the plist
